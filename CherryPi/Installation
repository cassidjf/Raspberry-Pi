Installation
CherryPy is a pure Python library. This has various consequences:

It can run anywhere Python runs
It does not require a C compiler
It can run on various implementations of the Python language: CPython, IronPython, Jython and PyPy

Requirements
CherryPy does not have any mandatory env requirements. Python-based distribution requirements are installed automatically by pip. However certain features it comes with will require you install certain packages. To simplify installing additional dependencies CherryPy enables you to specify extras in your requirements (e.g. cherrypy[json,routes_dispatcher,ssl]):

doc – for documentation related stuff
json – for custom JSON processing library
routes_dispatcher – routes for declarative URL mapping dispatcher
ssl – for OpenSSL bindings, useful in Python environments not having the builtin ssl module
testing
memcached_session – enables memcached backend session
xcgi
Supported python version
CherryPy supports Python 3.5 through to 3.7.

Installing
CherryPy can be easily installed via common Python package managers such as setuptools or pip.

$ easy_install cherrypy
$ pip install cherrypy
You may also get the latest CherryPy version by grabbing the source code from Github:

$ git clone https://github.com/cherrypy/cherrypy
$ cd cherrypy
$ python setup.py install
Test your installation
CherryPy comes with a set of simple tutorials that can be executed once you have deployed the package.

$ python -m cherrypy.tutorial.tut01_helloworld
Point your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080 and enjoy the magic.

Once started the above command shows the following logs:

[15/Feb/2014:21:51:22] ENGINE Listening for SIGHUP.
[15/Feb/2014:21:51:22] ENGINE Listening for SIGTERM.
[15/Feb/2014:21:51:22] ENGINE Listening for SIGUSR1.
[15/Feb/2014:21:51:22] ENGINE Bus STARTING

[15/Feb/2014:21:51:23] ENGINE Bus STARTED
We will explain what all those lines mean later on, but suffice to know that once you see the last two lines, your server is listening and ready to receive requests.

Run it
During development, the easiest path is to run your application as follow:

$ python myapp.py
As long as myapp.py defines a "__main__" section, it will run just fine.

cherryd
Another way to run the application is through the cherryd script which is installed along side CherryPy.

Note
This utility command will not concern you if you embed your application with another framework.
