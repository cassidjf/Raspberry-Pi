Thanks for sending.  I did a quick search for =E2=80=9Cdata=E2=80=9D and =
=E2=80=9Clearning=E2=80=9D and got zero hits.  Kind of interesting.  =
Several things that would rely on those topics, though, and the word =
=E2=80=9Cintelligent=E2=80=9D showed up a couple of times (usually in =
line with the old =E2=80=9Csmart products=E2=80=9D vision from ~1999).  =
The term =E2=80=9Ccontrol=E2=80=9D showed up (well, twice if you count =
the footer).

Most of the ideas struck me as sensible, but not =E2=80=9Cre-invent the =
company=E2=80=9D types of ideas.  Perhaps the wrong industry.

It might be interesting to bin these into a couple of major categories =
and see if anything popped out from that.

the Grand Challenge ideas captured.  If you have additional suggestions, =

I am working with the UTC Technical Council to down-select from the =

online discussions are a good way to keep the community connected as the =
Fellows are spread out across the globe.  We are planning for a UTC-wide =

person.  Please mark your calendar to save the date for September 20-22, =
2017 in East Hartford, CT.  More details will follow in the coming =
months.
